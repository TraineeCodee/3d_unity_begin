## âœ¨ Summary of First Impressions
This is my very first experience with Unity.  
- The **interface feels professional** but is easy to navigate once you understand the layout.  
- I like how the **Hierarchy, Scene, Game, and Inspector panels** are organized.  
- The **drag-and-drop workflow** makes it simple to add GameObjects and experiment.  
- The **Play mode** is very helpful for testing ideas quickly.  

Overall, Unity feels powerful but still beginner-friendly. I can already see how itâ€™s a strong tool for making both 2D and 3D games.
